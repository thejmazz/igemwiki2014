					We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
				</p>
				<p>
					A great example of complete attribution comes from the <a href="http://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Team">Imperial College London 2011 team</a> (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
